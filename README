sm-embedder

Demo project for a supermarket products embedder.

Dataset used for training:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16ERnsBosg0VrF6fUXR1lHXPOimIrzQbA?usp=sharing

Instructions:
1. Install the requirements with:

        pip install -r requirements.txt

NOTE: this is not a clean requirements.txt. It can install extra stuff.

2. Start with setup_for_train.ipynb. Change the dataset_dir and the build_dir
variables to the root of the original dataset and the root of the dir where you
want the artifacts to be generate, respectively.

3. Run all the cells on setup_for_train.ipynb.

4. After running all the cells, open the train.ipynb notebook. Change the
build_dir variable to the same dir of step 2.

5. Run all the cells.


Epilogue: There is a lot of encapsulation into .py files. Take a look at them
first if you feel like it.
